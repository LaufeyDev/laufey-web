            Over the years, I have been trying to seek knowledge and develop my perception,
            I was interested in seeking the meaning of life and the point of living.
            To gain knowledge and to seek the meaning I started reading many books related to philosphy rather than reading the Fiction stories.
            Gaining knowledge can be painful, here by pain I mean the confusion for the bigger circle of the
            known the greater the contact with the unknown. The process of gaining knowledge is indeed lonely. 
            The more you try gaining knowledge the more you get isolated, Dont get me wrong i do enjoy my own company but due to being isolated in order
            to gain knowledge I'm not really that good with people. There have been days  where I didn't even know what was going outside or the weather, I was immersed in the process of learning and understanding.
            The journey of trying to gain wisedom and knowledge is a joruney with no destination, it is a beautiful and a lonely path. One of the reason that you get lonely the further
            you move along is that most of the people around you, wont match the perception of reality and the level of open mindedness, Majority of them are intrested in materialistic pursuits.
            Being lonely allows you to get to know yourself better than anyone around you. According to me, learning about yourself is the first step to take in this path.
            Loneliness can be painful but it's worth the bliss.</P>
