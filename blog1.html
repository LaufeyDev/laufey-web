 <h1>
    Gaining knowledge and loneliness
</h1>
<hr />

<br>
<p>
    Over the years, I have been trying to seek knowledge and develop my perception.
    <br>
    I was interested in seeking the meaning of life and the point of living.
    <br>
    To gain knowledge and to seek the meaning I started reading many books
    <br>
    related to philosphy rather than reading the Fiction stories. Gaining knowledge

    <br>
    can be painful, here by pain I mean the confusion for the bigger circle of the
    <br>
    known the greater the contact with the unknown. The process of gaining knowledge
    <br>
    is indeed lonely. The more you try gaining knowledge the more you get isolated,
    <br>
    Dont get me wrong i do enjoy my own company but due to being isolated in order
    <br>
    to gain knowledge I'm not really that good with people. There have been days
    <br>
    where I didn't even know what was going outside or the weather, I was 
    <br>
    immersed in the process of learning and understanding.
    <br>
    <br>
    The journey of trying to gain wisedom and knowledge is a joruney with no destination,
    <br>
    it is a beautiful and a lonely path. one of the reason that you get lonely the further
    <br>
    you move along is that most of the people around you, wont match the perception of reality 
    <br>
    and the level of open mindness. Majority of them are intrested in materialistic pursuits.
    <br>
    <br>
    Being lonely allows you to get to know yourself better than anyone around you.
    <br>
    According to me, learning about yourself is the first step to take in this path.
    <br>
    Loneliness can be painful but it's worth the bliss.
